## Description

 Have you ever wondered what genre of media you tend to prefer? Do you ever question what to watch next after finishing a great movie?  Genrefy is the exact website to help with your search. At our website, you list off five movies that will ask you to select the genre it would fall under and a rating. After submitting five movies, the website provides you with the genre that you watched the most of and a log of how you rated each movie. We built this project in order to help people find out what they like best, and how to find the next piece of media they could consume. Our motivation comes from our own interest in different movies and frustration that comes with wondering "Well now what do I watch?". In this project, we learned best how to pair program with one another; we learned how to deploy our site and make it live. We learned how to write JavaScript code to make our site interactive, and then we learned that it look several sessions of debugging to make it perfect for our users. In the end, we hope that this site is helpful for you to use and that our hard work paid off!

## Installation 

 Open your preferred browser, and follow the link to site. No additional setup needed.

## Usage

## Future Features

Since this project was our first, we were thinking MVP. However, there were some features we wanted to include if we had the opportunity to add to the project. One of those ideas was to create a ranking system of these movies, that instead of creating a list of the most popular genres the user inputed, but how highly they rated each movie. This would look like the top three genres based on rating; another idea was to incorporate different forms of media such as TV shows, video games, books, etc. Another idea we would have loved to add was to create a list of each movie for everytime the user used the website and store it so that they could come back and see what movies they watched and how they rated it. Our original idea was too similar to other websites already created and a little too complex for our first assignment, but perhaps this could turn into a reccomendation app that provides people with what to watch next after they have finished a book series or TV series. All in all, these features would be amazing to add and we hope we get the chance to in the future.
